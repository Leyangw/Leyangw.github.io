I am currently a Master's student in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) at UCL (2024–2025). My Master's thesis project is supervised by [Prof. David Barber](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) and [Dr. Mingtian Zhang](https://mingtian.ai/) at the UCL AI Centre. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics with Statistics at the University of Bristol (2021–2024), where my independent project was supervised by [Dr.Rihuan Ke](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Rihuan-Ke-1e1de8f2-07dc-490c-8323-e6696261a710/).  

Upon graduation from my Master's programme, I will join the Generic Technology Research Group, Deep Learning Theory Team at RIKEN-AIP as a Research Associate under the supervision of [Prof. Taiji Suzuki](https://ibis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/suzuki/). I am also a part-time Research Assistant in the IntellEcT Systems group at the UCL AI Centre under the supervision of [Dr. Jagmohan Chauhan](https://sites.google.com/view/jagmohan-chauhan), where my research focuses on continual learning in concept-based multi-modal diffusion models.  

My academic interests lie in statistical machine learning, with a particular focus on generative models such as diffusion models. I am especially interested in approaching general machine learning problems through the lens of statistical discrepancy minimization.  

I also work closely with [Prof. Song Liu](https://allmodelsarewrong.net) in my spare time.
