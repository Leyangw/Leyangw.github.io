I am a master's student in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL (2024-2025). I completed my bachelor's degree in Mathematics with Statistics at the University of Bristol (2021-2024). My academic interests lie in statistical machine learning, with a particular focus on generative models such diffusion models. I am especially interested in approaching general machine learning problems through the lens of statistical discrepancy minimization.

I also work closely with [Prof. Song Liu](https://allmodelsarewrong.net).
