I am a [Research Associate](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/deep_learn_theory/index.html) at the Generic Technology Research Group, Deep Learning Theory Team at RIKEN-AIP, under the supervision of [Prof. Taiji Suzuki](https://ibis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/suzuki/).

### Education
I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics with Statistics, graduating with *First Class Honours*, at the University of Bristol (2021–2024). I completed my Master's degree in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) at University College London (UCL) (2024–2025) with *Distinction*. My Master's thesis project is supervised by [Prof. David Barber](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) and [Dr. Mingtian Zhang](https://mingtian.ai/) at the UCL AI Centre.

I also work closely with [Prof. Song Liu](https://allmodelsarewrong.net) in my spare time.

The first project was conducted during my master's thesis project while the second and forth projects were (partially) carried out during my undergraduate summer bursary placement at the University of Bristol School of Mathematics, **funded by the [Heilbronn Institute](https://heilbronn.ac.uk/) for Mathematical Research**.

### Awards, Scholarships & Bursaries

My research interests lie in statistical machine learning, with a focus on deep generative models and their applications to computer vision. I am particularly interested in developing principled methods for solving high-dimensional machine learning problems through statistical discrepancies minimisation.
