I am a master's student in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL. I completed my bachelor's degree in Mathematics with Statistics at the University of Bristol. My academic interests lie in statistical machine learning, with a particular focus on generative models such as ODE/SDE-based diffusion models. I am especially interested in approaching general machine learning problems through the lens of statistical discrepancy minimization.

Despite my current study at UCL, I work closely with [Prof. Song Liu](https://allmodelsarewrong.net).
