I am currently a Master's student in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) at University College London (UCL) (2024–2025). My Master's thesis project is supervised by [Prof. David Barber](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) and [Dr. Mingtian Zhang](https://mingtian.ai/) at the UCL AI Centre, focusing on [distilling knowledge from a pre-trained diffusion model into a one-step generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20646). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics with Statistics, graduating with *First Class Honours*, at the University of Bristol (2021–2024). My undergraduate independent project was supervised by [Dr. Rihuan Ke](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Rihuan-Ke-1e1de8f2-07dc-490c-8323-e6696261a710/), where I proposed a method for solving inverse imaging problems by enforcing prior-based constraints.  

Upon graduation from my Master's programme, I will join the Generic Technology Research Group, Deep Learning Theory Team at RIKEN-AIP as a Research Associate under the supervision of [Prof. Taiji Suzuki](https://ibis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/suzuki/). My role will focus on improving diffusion models through a density ratio–based approach. I am also currently a part-time Research Assistant in the IntellEcT Systems group at the UCL AI Centre under the supervision of [Dr. Jagmohan Chauhan](https://sites.google.com/view/jagmohan-chauhan), where my work focuses on continual learning in concept-based multi-modal diffusion models.  

My academic interests lie in statistical machine learning, with a particular focus on generative models such as diffusion models. I am especially interested in approaching general machine learning problems through the lens of statistical discrepancy minimisation.  

I also work closely with [Prof. Song Liu](https://allmodelsarewrong.net) in my spare time. Our joint work includes [differential parameter inference in exponential families](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v258/williams25a.html), [natural gradient descent for time-varying generative models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07650), and [missing data imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11749). The first and third projects were (partially) carried out during my undergraduate summer bursary placement at the University of Bristol School of Mathematics, funded by the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research.
