I currently am a Master's student in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL (2024-2025), my master thesis project is supervised by [Prof. David Barber](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) and [Dr. Mingtian Zhang](https://mingtian.ai/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics with Statistics at the University of Bristol (2021-2024). My academic interests lie in statistical machine learning, with a particular focus on generative models such diffusion models. I am especially interested in approaching general machine learning problems through the lens of statistical discrepancy minimization.

I also work closely with [Prof. Song Liu](https://allmodelsarewrong.net) in my spare time.
